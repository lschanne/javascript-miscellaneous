#### Version 1.0 ####
Pretty much a very simple implementation of the classic game of Asteroids.

For now, there will be a set number of asteroids that are randomly generated.
Each one will maintain a consist velocity and radius throughout.

We will screen wrap around the edges.

I might even add a timer at the top right. TBD.

The first pass will borrow heavily from
